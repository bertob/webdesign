        An informal introduction to designing and building websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        For designers, economists, and everyone else who’s always wanted to do something with “code” but never got the right start.
      </p>
      <p>
        By a group of students from the CS faculty who just kind of feel like doing it.

      <p>
        Starting in January and throughout the rest of the year, this hands-on workshop will teach you the basics of modern web design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll take a pragmatic, project-based approach, which means you’ll be able to apply everything you learn to your very own website, which you’ll be building throughout the course.
      </p>

      Here’s our roadmap:
    </p>

    <h2 class="lesson-title"><a href="https://github.com/bertob/webdesign/blob/master/chapter1.md">Lesson 1: Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>
      We’ll give you a quick introduction to how the web works, help you get set up with the tools you’ll need and dive right into HTML and CSS. By the end of the lesson you’ll have built your first website!

    <h2 class="lesson-title">Lesson 2: Layout</h2>
    <p>
      We’ll get into more powerful CSS layout techniques, and give you some insight into how a real-world website works. You’ll learn exciting things such as centering containers and (*gasp*) placing things alongside each other!
