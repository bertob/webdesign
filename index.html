        An informal introduction to designing and building websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        For designers, economists, and everyone else who’s always wanted to do something with “code” but never got the right start.
      </p>
      <p>
        By a group of students from the CS faculty who just kind of feel like doing it.

      <p>
        Starting in January and throughout the rest of the year, this hands-on workshop will teach you the basics of modern web design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll take a pragmatic, project-based approach, which means you’ll be able to apply everything you learn to your very own website, which you’ll be building throughout the course.
      </p>

      Here’s our roadmap:
    </p>

    <h2 class="lesson-title"><a href="https://github.com/bertob/webdesign/blob/master/chapter1.md">Lesson 1: Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>
      We’ll give you a quick introduction to how the web works, help you get set up with the tools you’ll need and dive right into HTML and CSS. By the end of the lesson you’ll have built your first website!

    <h2 class="lesson-title"><a href="https://github.com/bertob/webdesign/blob/master/chapter2.md">Lesson 2: Layout</a></h2>
    <p>
      We’ll get into more powerful CSS layout techniques, and give you some insight into how a real-world website works. You’ll learn exciting things such as centering containers and (*gasp*) placing things alongside each other!
    </p>
    <p>
      Please install <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a> before the lesson, because it makes finding mistakes much easier if everyone is using the same browser.

    <h2 class="lesson-title"><a href="https://github.com/bertob/webdesign/blob/master/chapter2.md">Lesson 3: Layout Pt. 2</a></h2>
    <p>
      We’ll recap the things we did in January and you’ll get feedback on your projects. After that, we’ll talk about inline and block elements, and how they relate to the box model.

    <h2 class="lesson-title"><a href="https://github.com/bertob/webdesign/blob/master/chapter3.md">Lesson 4: Going Live</a></h2>
    <p>
      You’ll get some feedback on your projects, and we’ll show you how to publish your site to Github Pages. By the end of the lesson, you’ll have your own website on the public internet!

    <h2 class="lesson-title"><a href="https://github.com/bertob/webdesign/blob/master/chapter3.md">Lesson 4: Going Live (again)</a></h2>
    <p>
      Because a lot of people couldn’t make it the previous week and we had some technical problems, we’ll repeat lesson 4. We’ll also show you a few new CSS layout techniques to make your sites even more awesome.

    <h2 class="lesson-title">Lesson 5: Implementing Layout</h2>
    <p>
      This week we’ll get more serious about the projects. We’ll discuss different layout strategies to implement the design concepts you prepared as homework assignments since last time, and go through the process of building a full website layout from scratch together.
